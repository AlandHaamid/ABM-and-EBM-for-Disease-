# ABM-and-EBM-for-Disease-
Simulating the spread of a disease within a population using  Agent and Equation-Based Models

My project aims to design two separate artefacts using Agent-Based Models (ABM) and 
Equation-Based Models (EBM). Using these two diverse modelling techniques we can see the 
effect, spread and damage of a disease within a population. In order for me to achieve this
you would need understand the compartmentalised models in 
epidemiology specifically the SIR model (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered), once the 
artefacts are created the results would be compared to the real world data which can be found on
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and your goverment website.

You then compare the data generated from both models to identify wich one give you the most accurate result.
